# On continuing The Iron Yard's legacy in Tampa Bay...

> **TL;DR:** The work done by The Iron Yard's team and our community will continue.

When The Iron Yard came to St. Petersburg in 2014, it brought along its mission to connect people with the craft and lifelong adventure of technology and programming. Through its full-time immersive curriculum, our instructors had a proven track record of equipping students with the skills they needed to both get started and progress throughout their careers. Each of our campus' seven "Demo Day" events successively brought more and more of Tampa Bay's best technology companies together, looking to bring these new developers into the workforce.

Our immersive program was a 12-week course with a career-focused curriculum. Students learned what it takes to become successful web developers in the industry today. Our campus boasted a 98% job placement rate for graduates. Our top-notch career support continued to assist alumni as they transitioned from their first junior roles and grew into their own as full-fledged developers.

We also became a central hub in the Tampa Bay tech community. Our doors were open to dozens of meet-up groups. Three nights a week the space hosted at least two different public events. In addition to the outside community groups that used the space, we offered free monthly crash-courses as well as our enormously popular Kid's Classes led by volunteer instructors.

## These Efforts Should Not Be Abandoned.

It has become increasingly apparent that as Tampa Bay's information technology industry grows, the skill shortage continues to grow along with it. Seasoned software engineers are highly sought after by firms looking to meet these needs. Students who completed our program were equipped with the hands-on practical experience needed to begin to fill the talent gap. As these junior developers continued to be nurtured and mentored in the workforce, they provided immense benefit to our local economy.

Another critical component is the fostering of a healthy tech community. Each week events on the campus reached hundreds of people- not only sharing knowledge, but sharing our culture and values. The alumni network, spread across dozens of local companies, helped achieve our goal of promoting diversity of all kinds across the technology sector.

## Improving On the Mission.

Not every person who will make a great developer tomorrow is a fit for our program today. Some are not in the position to give three or four months for total immersion, while others are not prepared for this "drinking from a firehose" pace. For some, the cost is just simply out of reach. We believe these areas to be currently underserved.

Part-time and softer introductory offerings would help to bring opportunities to parts of our community that need it most. In many ways the meet-ups, our alumni and community volunteers are already making this happen. We believe we can make this a core goal of the school and ask more of the community to help us achieve it.

Many students come to us who start from ground-zero. We see our task as teaching students to "learn how to learn" programming. While we pride ourselves in achieving this with all of our graduates, our strongest students are those who know what they've signed up for and already have had a taste for "the joy of code". By providing a clearly-defined starting path for the *absolute beginners* we can also raise the bar for students accepted to our full-time program as apprentices. A student will graduate with an even *stronger* skillset; ready to begin their professional career as a true journeyman developer. Traditionally the path from apprentice, to journeyman, to a master craftsman is overseen by a guild.

## What is The Suncoast Developers Guild?

The Suncoast Developers Guild, founded in 2015, is a informal collective of software engineers, programmers, and designers in the Tampa Bay Area. It boasts membership by dozens of meet-up groups representing thousands of local developers. The Slack team is over 1000 users strong and has 163 channels dedicated to discussing topics of programming and technology. The goals of the organization are closely aligned with The Iron Yard's own mission. The Suncoast Developers Guild's current mission reads as such:

> Our purpose is to promote a sense of community among local technology organizations and their members. We seek to better communication between leaders, centralize efforts, improve culture, and to support our members in a way that strengthens our community and promotes the common good.

We believe that what our campus has helped build with the community in St. Petersburg and all around Tampa Bay should continue, and that The Suncoast Developers Guild is the ideal way to fulfill that vision.

## Looking Forward.

We look to expand the scope of The Suncoast Developers Guild's mission and continue the work of our team: **to provide access to code education for everyone.**

- Continue our immersive full-time education for students accepted into our program, paid for by tuition or sponsored scholarships.
- Continue to expand on part-time curriculum for children and adults led by our instructors and community volunteers. These programs would serve as a prerequisite for (and lead students into) our immersive offerings.
- Continue to provide event space for meet-up organizers.
- Open co-working for volunteer mentors.
- Bespoke training for employees of corporate sponsors.

By offering cooperative memberships to donors and volunteer mentors we believe these companies and individuals will have a vested interest in strengthening the community that they are already a part of.
