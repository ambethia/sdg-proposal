# Course Offerings

## Immersive Bootcamp

Our primary focus will continue to be the a full-time, 12 week program designed to prepare students to enter a new career as a junior web developer.

- Full-time, expert instructors
- Extensive programming curriculum including lecture and flipped classroom formats.
- Career support, including: soft-skills, portfolio building, and interview techniques.
- A 3-4 week capstone project that encompassed the skills learned through the program.
- A Demo day showcase event for graduates to be introduced to the community

See the [prospective syllabus](syllabus) for a detailed breakdown of course content.

## Co-working Membership

As an additional revenue source, we would open the doors for co-working to invite community members to spend more time on campus.

- Full access to the space to use for co-working for members.
- Membership fees would be competitive with other co-working spaces. E.g. $100 monthly, $10 daily drop-in
- Senior developers in the community can donate time as volunteers to be available as mentors in leu of paying membership fee.

## Crash Courses, Community Events

We would improve upon our crash courses and free kids classes by creating an introductory curriculum that would also serve as prerequisite knowledge for acceptance into our full-time program. Taught by a combination of staff, community members and alumni, these classes would continue to be free, with the possibility of low-cost all day workshops as well.

## Expenses

- Team salaries & benefits
- HR & accounting expenses (unlikely we'll need someone on this full-time)
- Location overhead and expenses (e.g. rent, utilities, furniture)
- Advertising & Marketing efforts
- Other costs, e.g. events (demo day), travel (conferences), and computer equipment

## Summary of additional (possible) sources of revenue in addition to immersive program tuition

- Co-working memberships
- Workshops
- Ongoing mentorship retainers paid by employers
- Sponsored scholarships
- Sponsorship of events
