# On continuing The Iron Yard's legacy in Tampa Bay...

When The Iron Yard came to St Petersburg in 2014 it brought it's mission of connecting with people the craft and lifelong adventure of technology and programming. Through it's full-time immersive curriculum, the instructors had a proven track record of equipping them with the skills they needed to both get started and progress throughout their careers. Each of The Iron Yard's seven Demo Day events successively brought more and more of Tampa Bay's best technology companies together, looking to bring our graduates into the workforce. As time went on the campus' top-notch career support continued to assist alumni as they transitions from their first junior roles and grew into their own as full fledged developers.

The Iron Yard also became a central hub in the Tampa Bay tech community. It's doors were open to dozens of Meetup groups. Three nights each week, the space hosted 2 or 3 different public events. In addition to the individual groups that used the space, The Iron Yard itself offered free monthly crash-courses and our enormously popular kid's classes.

## Why these efforts should not be abandoned

It is well understood, that as Tampa Bay's information technology industry grows, the skill shortage continues to become more apparent. Seasoned software engineers are highly sought after by firms looking to meet these needs. Students coming out of The Iron Yard are equipped with the hands-on practical experience needed to begin filling the talent gap. As these Junior developers continue to be nurtured and mentored in the workforce, they provide immense benefit to our local economy.

Another critical component is the fostering a healthy tech community. Each week events at The Iron Yard reached hundreds of people, not only sharing knowledge, but also it's culture and values. The alumni network, spread across dozens of local companies, help achieve the goal of promoting diversity of all kinds across the technology sector.
